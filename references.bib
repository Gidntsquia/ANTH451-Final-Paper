  abstract = {The use of bioavailable strontium in different environments to provenance biological materials has become increasingly common since its first applications in ecology and archaeology almost four decades ago. Provenancing biological materials using strontium isotope ratios requires a map of bioavailable strontium, commonly known as an isoscape, to compare results with. Both producing the isoscape and using it to interpret results present methodological challenges that researchers must carefully consider. A review of current research indicates that, while many archives can be analyzed to produce isoscapes, modern plant materials usually provide the best approximation of bioavailable strontium and can be used alone or combined with other archives if applying machine learning. Domain mapping currently produces the most accurate, most interpretable isoscapes for most research questions; however, machine learning approaches promise to provide more accurate and geographically wide-ranging isoscapes over time. Using strontium isotope analysis for provenancing is most successful when combined with other isotopes and/or trace elements as part of a likelihood approach. Strontium isoscapes that are both appropriate and sufficiently high resolution to answer specific research questions do not exist for most parts of the world. Researchers intending to incorporate strontium analysis into their research designs should expect to conduct primary sampling and analysis to create appropriate isoscapes or refine existing ones, which should themselves not be uncritically utilized. When sampling, it is essential to collect appropriate metadata; these metadata and the results of the analyses should be archived in one of several online databases to maximize their usefulness. With increasing amounts of primary data and the likely increased availability of machine learning approaches to mapping, strontium analysis will continue to improve as a method of provenancing.}

  abstract = {{Isotope analysis has become an increasingly valuable tool in forensic anthropology casework over the past decade. Modern-day isotopic investigations on human remains have integrated the use of multi-isotope profiles (e.g. C, N, O, H, S, Sr, and Pb) as well as isotopic landscapes (“isoscapes”) from multiple body tissues (e.g. teeth, bone, hair, and nails) to predict possible region-of-origin of unidentified human remains. Together, data from various isotope analyses provide additional lines of evidence for human identification, including a decedent’s possible region-of-birth, long-term adult residence, recent travel history, and dietary choices. Here, we present the basic principles of isotope analysis and provide a brief overview of instrumentation, analytical standards, sample selection, and sample quality measures. Finally, we present case studies that reflect the diverse applications of isotope analysis to the medicolegal system before describing some future research directions. As shown herein, isotope analysis is a flexible and powerful geolocation tool that can provide new investigative leads for unidentified human remains cases.}},

  abstract = {Two men walking across a bridge along highway I-75 found a young woman's body floating in the water below. This 1971 case has since become known as the “Little Miss Panasofkee” case. It is still an open homicide, for which neither the victim nor the perpetrator have been identified. Throughout the United States, thousands of similar cases remain open. The medicolegal communities work on these cases, as the years pass, applying new scientific methods and following new leads as they can be developed. As the years pass, the priorities of the investigations often shift. In any homicide investigation the goal is to solve the murder and bring the perpetrator to justice. While this is still true for long-term open or cold cases, the needs of families to know the truth, find and bury remains, and find closure outside of criminal trials become increasingly important. In the case study presented here, we reanalyzed the biological profile of the decedent, created a new facial approximation and imaging for visualization of personal evidence, and analyzed samples of hair, bone, and enamel for Sr, Pb, C, N, and O isotopes to decipher a geographical place of origin for the decedent. Hair data show a shift from lighter to heavier C isotopic values indicating a diet change from more grain-based (hair tip) to more corn-based (hair root) diet. Oxygen isotopes in teeth show relatively heavy isotopic values suggesting southern geographical origin near a major water basin. Lead isotopic data for teeth and bone samples show relatively low-radiogenic values suggesting that the victim was born and raised in Europe. There is shift to low 87Sr/86Sr from first to third molar and bone indicating possible migration and dietary change. Taken together, the radiogenic and stable isotope data indicate that the decedent was foreign born. The shift in the hair C isotopes suggests that the victim arrived in Florida/United States between 2 and 12 months before she was murdered. The Pb isotope data suggest European origin. Considering all of the chemical data, including Pb concentrations and Pb, Sr, O, and C isotope analyses on teeth, rib, and hair samples, we can suggest that the victim was most likely a foreigner from southeastern Europe, possibly Greece. The methods used here and the impact of these methods for developing new leads for investigators decades later are discussed and provide new avenues of investigation for other unsolved cases.},

  abstract      = {Strontium isotopic analysis of sequentially formed tissues, such as tooth enamel, is commonly used to study provenance and mobility of humans and animals. However, the potential of 87Sr/86Sr in tooth enamel to track high-frequency movements has not yet been established, in part due to the lack of data on modern animals of known movement and predictive model of isotope variation across the landscape. To tackle this issue, we measured the 87Sr/86Sr in plant samples taken from a 2000 km2 area in the Altai Mountains (Mongolia), and the 87Sr/86Sr in tooth enamel of domestic caprines whose mobility was monitored using GPS tracking. We show that high-resolution, sequential profiles of strontium isotope composition of tooth enamel reliably reflect the high-frequency mobility of domestic livestock and that short-term residency of about 45 days can be resolved. This offers new perspectives in various disciplines, including forensics, ecology, palaeoanthropology, and bioarchaeology.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Strontium (Sr) isotope analysis can provide detailed biogeographical and ecological information about modern and ancient organisms. Because Sr isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) in biologically relevant materials such as water, soil, vegetation, and animal tissues predominantly reflect local geology, they can be used to distinguish geologically distinct regions as well as identify highly mobile individuals or populations. While the application of Sr isotope analysis to biological research has been steadily increasing, high analytical costs have prohibited more widespread use. Additionally, accessibility of this geochemical tool has been hampered due to limited understanding of (i) the degree to which biologically relevant materials differ in their spatial averaging of 87Sr/86Sr ratios, and (ii) how these differences may be affected by lithologic complexity. A recently developed continental-scale model that accounts for variability in bedrock weathering rates and predicts Sr isotope ratios of surface water could help resolve these questions. In addition, if this ‘local water’ model can accurately predict 87Sr/86Sr ratios for other biologically relevant materials, there would be reduced need for researchers to assess regional Sr isotope patterns empirically. Here, we compile 87Sr/86Sr data for surface water, soil, vegetation, and mammalian and fish skeletal tissues from the literature and compare the accuracy with which the local water model predicts Sr isotope data among these five materials across the contiguous USA. We find that measured Sr isotope ratios for all five materials are generally close to those predicted by the local water model, although not with uniform accuracy. Mammal skeletal tissues are most accurately predicted, particularly in regions with low variability in 87Sr/86Sr predicted by the local water model. Increasing regional geologic heterogeneity increases both the offset and variance between modelled and empirical Sr isotope ratios, but its effects are broadly similar across materials. The local water model thus provides a readily available source of background data for predicting 87Sr/86Sr for biologically relevant materials in places where empirical data are lacking. The availability of increasingly high-quality modelled Sr data will dramatically expand the accessibility of this geochemical tool to ecological applications.},

  abstract = {Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) are a popular tool in provenance applications in archeology, forensics, paleoecology, and environmental sciences. Using bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr in provenance studies requires comparing the 87Sr/86Sr of a sample of interest to that of 87Sr/86Sr baselines. Historically, these baselines required building empirical datasets from plants or local animals to characterize the 87Sr/86Sr available to local ecosystems (bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr). However, researchers are increasingly relying on modeled bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr maps (called isoscapes). We review the advantages and limitations of existing approaches to mapping bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr for provenance studies and propose a globally applicable, scalable, and editable framework for creating bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes. This framework relies on: 1) Compiling global bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data; 2) Mapping 87Sr/86Sr variability in rocks; 3) Leveraging global environmental covariates; and 4) Applying a random forest regression method that integrates these data to predict bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr. When the random-forest model is applied at the global scale it performs well (explaining 60% of the variance of the global bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr dataset), and accounts for geological, geomorphological and atmospheric controls. In data-rich regions (e.g., Europe), the global bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr isoscape can be successfully extrapolated to broad regions without bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data. However, we also show that this extrapolation may not be valid in exceptionally geologically complex and data-poor regions (e.g., Madagascar). We suggest research directions to improve the accuracy of global bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes, which include: 1) Increasing the collection of bioavailable datasets in data-poor regions; 2) Harmonizing data management practices and metadata collection for bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data; and 3) Relying on advances in remote sensing and geological mapping techniques to improve geological covariates. While significant potential to refine 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes remains, the data products provided in this review form a basis for using 87Sr/86Sr data in large-scale provenance studies, opening new research avenues in a range of fields.}

However, traditional interpolation algorithms and classification approaches used to generate Sr isoscapes are often limited in predicting multiscale 87Sr/86Sr patterning. Here we investigate the suitability of plant samples and soil leachates from the IRHUM database (www.irhumdatabase.com) to create a bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr map using a novel geostatistical framework. First, we generated an 87Sr/86Sr map by classifying 87Sr/86Sr values into five geologically-representative isotope groups using cluster analysis. The isotope groups were then used as a covariate in kriging to integrate prior geological knowledge of Sr cycling with the information contained in the bioavailable dataset and enhance 87Sr/86Sr predictions. Our approach couples the strengths of classification and geostatistical methods to generate more accurate 87Sr/86Sr predictions (Root Mean Squared Error = 0.0029) with an estimate of spatial uncertainty based on lithology and sample density. This bioavailable Sr isoscape is applicable for provenance studies in France, and the method is transferable to other areas with high sampling density. While our method is a step forward in generating accurate 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes, the remaining uncertainty also demonstrates that fine-modelling of 87Sr/86Sr variability is challenging and requires more than geological maps for accurately predicting 87Sr/86Sr variations across the landscape. Future efforts should focus on increasing sampling density and developing predictive models to further quantify and predict the processes that lead to 87Sr/86Sr variability.}

  abstract      = {Archaeological glass contains information about the movement of goods and ancient economies, yet our understanding of critical aspects of the ancient glass industry is fragmentary. During Roman times, distinct glass types produced in coastal regions of Egypt and the Levant used evaporitic soda (natron) mixed with Nile-derived sands. In the Levant, furnaces for producing colourless Roman glass by addition of manganese have been uncovered, whereas the source of the desirable antimony-decolourised Roman glass remains an enigma. In the Edict of Diocletian, this colourless glass is listed as ``Alexandrian''referring to Egypt, but its origin has been ambiguous. Previous studies have found overlapping strontium and neodymium isotope ratios for Levantine and Egyptian glass. Here, we confirm these findings and show for the first time, based on glasses from the ancient city of Gerasa, that hafnium (Hf) isotopes are different in Egyptian and Levantine natron glasses, and that Sb Roman glass is Egyptian. Our work illustrates the value of Hf isotopes in provenancing archaeological glass. We attribute the striking difference in Hf isotopes of Egyptian versus Levantine glasses to sorting of zircons in Nile sediments during longshore drift and aeolian transport along the south-eastern Mediterranean coast leaving behind a less juvenile fraction.},

The great henge complexes of southern Britain are iconic monuments of the third millennium BCE, representing great feats of engineering and labor mobilization that hosted feasting events on a previously unparalleled scale. The scale of movement and the catchments that the complexes served, however, have thus far eluded understanding. Presenting the largest five-isotope system archeological dataset (87Sr/86Sr, δ34S, δ18O, δ13C, and δ15N) yet fully published, we analyze 131 pigs, the prime feasting animals, from four Late Neolithic (approximately 2800 to 2400 BCE) complexes to explore the networks that the feasts served. Because archeological evidence excludes continental contact, sources are considered only in the context of the British Isles. This analysis reveals wide-ranging origins across Britain, with few pigs raised locally. This finding demonstrates great investment of effort in transporting pigs raised elsewhere over vast distances to supply feasts and evidences the very first phase of pan-British connectivity.}

  abstract  = {A foreign dynasty, known as the Hyksos, ruled parts of Egypt between c. 1638–1530 BCE. Their origins are thought to be rooted in the Near East, which is supported by architectural features and grave accoutrements of Tell el-Dabca. In this former Hyksos capital in the Eastern Nile Delta, burial culture is characterized by a blend of Egyptian and Near Eastern elements. However, investigations are still ongoing as to where the Hyksos came from and how they rose to power. The aim of this study is to elucidate the question of possible provenience. We present the results of strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) ratios of human tooth enamel (n = 75) from Tell el-Dabca, focusing on comparing pre- and during Hyksos rule and sex-based differences. An influx of non-locals can be observed in the pre-Hyksos period (12th and 13th Dynasties, c. 1991–1649 BCE) during the constitution of this important harbor town, while the number of individuals already born in the Delta is larger during the Hyksos period. This is consistent with the supposition that, while the ruling class had Near Eastern origins, the Hyksos’ rise to power was not the result of an invasion, as popularly theorized, but an internal dominance and takeover of foreign elite. There is a preponderance of non-local females suggesting patrilocal residence. We discuss our findings against the current evidence of material culture and historiography, but more investigation in Near Eastern comparative sites has to be conducted to narrow our future search for the actual origins of the Hyksos.},

This paper aims to contribute to the isoscape in the northeastern Nile Delta with faunal samples from the site of Tell el-Dab?a (Avaris), believed to be the capital of the so-called Hyksos kings. Mapping the available {$^8$}{$^7$}Sr/{$^8$}{$^6$}Sr ratios from Egypt and the Sudan highlights major research gaps outside the Nile region. ?e current corpus of knowledge also shows that the Nile River region yields a homogenous range of isotopic values (median and IQR 0.7076 0.0003). Strontium isotope ratios from human dental enamel, which record childhood residence, will provide evidence of non-locals from outside the Nile area with confidence but these values suggest that identifying movement along the Nile River in the past will be difficult without the use of supplementary evidence (e.g. oxygen stable isotope analysis). We present {$^8$}{$^7$}Sr/{$^8$}{$^6$}Sr ratios of archaeologically-derived faunal bone samples (n=6) from the site of Tell el-Dab?a (Avaris) in the northeastern Nile Delta. ?e {$^8$}{$^7$}Sr/{$^8$}{$^6$}Sr ratios fit within the expectations of the wider Nile values (mean 0.70769 0.00003) and serve as the first archaeologically-derived values reported for this area of Egypt.}

  abstract      = {Millions of mummified birds serving for religious purpose have been discovered from archeological sites along the Nile Valley of Egypt, in majority ibises. Whether these birds were industrially raised or massively hunted is a matter of heavy debate as it would have a significant impact on the economy related to their supply and cult, and if hunted it would have represented an ecological burden on the birds populations. Here we have measured and analysed the stable oxygen, carbon and radiogenic strontium isotope compositions as well as calcium and barium content of bones along with the stable carbon, nitrogen and sulfur isotope composition of feathers from 20 mummified ibises and birds of prey recovered from various archeological sites of Ancient Egypt. If these migratory birds were locally bred, their stable oxygen, radiogenic strontium and stable sulfur isotopic compositions would be similar to that of coexisting Egyptians, and their stable carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotope variance would be close, or lower than that of Egyptians. On one hand, isotopic values show that ibises ingested food from the Nile valley but with a higher isotopic scattering than observed for the diet of ancient Egyptians. On the other hand, birds of prey have exotic isotopic values compatible with their migratory behaviour. We therefore propose that most mummified ibises and all the birds of prey analysed here were wild animals hunted for religious practice.},

Local ranges, determined from faunal sampling, have been suggested for several sites in Nubia, including Tombos (Third Cataract, Sudan). This study builds on previous research by testing human and faunal dental enamel samples from three sites in the Third Cataract region: Tombos, Hannek, and Abu Fatima. The addition of Abu Fatima and Hannek into the assessment of the Third Cataract region brings new temporal and socioeconomic juxtapositions that can shed light on migration and locality in Bronze Age Nubia. Two faunal samples, a sheep from Abu Fatima and a horse from Tombos, had 87Sr/86Sr values that were consistent with the previously established local Third Cataract strontium range. Seven of the 29 human samples tested for Abu Fatima are suggestive of non-local origin and consistent with the Second Cataract region. One of the four individuals tested from Hannek may have migrated to the region from Egypt or the Second Cataract region. Lastly, four of the 30 samples from Tombos indicate possible non-local origin; the 87Sr/86Sr values may suggest Egypt, the Second Cataract, or the Fourth Cataract as places of origin. These findings suggest complex human migration networks were present in the Nile Valley during the Bronze Age. We support the continued examination of migration using strontium while acknowledging that further research needs to be done.}

  abstract      = {The origin of the Hyksos dynasty (c. 1638--1530 BCE) is thought to be rooted in the Near East given the architectural features and burial customs present at the site of Tell el-Dabca, identified as the capital of Hyksos rule in the Eastern Delta of Egypt. We expand previous 87Sr/86Sr research on the site's cemetery assemblage using a multi-isotopic methodology: oxygen (δ18O) and carbon (δ13Ccarb) stable isotopes from the carbonate portion of tooth enamel (n = 75), along with collagen (δ13Ccoll, δ15N) analysis of dentine and bone (n = 31). Pairing δ18O with previous 87Sr/86Sr data identifies 60{\%} of the cohort as non-locals (45/75). Although there were a greater proportion of non-local females (24/30, 80{\%}) compared to males (10/20, 50{\%}), there were no significant differences between the sexes in δ13Ccarb or δ18Ocarb values. There were no spatial patterns regarding the three cemetery sites, nor any observable patterns regarding where non-locals were interred in the largest excavated cemetery, Area A/II. Both first-generation immigrants and individuals from the northeastern Nile Delta were buried following elite Asiatic burial customs, suggesting continuation of foreign burial culture. All collagen showed poor preservation; δ13Ccoll and δ15N analysis were not possible. δ13Ccarb showed no significant difference between locals and non-local diet, although non-locals at Tell el-Dabca did eat a broader variety of foods as a group, suggested by a wider δ13Ccarb range (−13.5 to −9.6‰in non-locals compared to locals'−12.1 to −10.3‰). If there is a difference in food culture between immigrants and native Egyptians, it was not observable using isotopic analyses.},

Although it is known that a very large number of these ‘votive’ mummies were sacrificed to the Egyptian God Thoth, how the ancient Egyptians obtained millions of these birds for mummification remains unresolved. Ancient Egyptian textual evidences suggest they may have been raised in dedicated large-scale farms. To investigate the most likely method used by the priests to secure birds for mummification, we report the first study of complete mitochondrial genomes of 14 Sacred Ibis mummies interred ~2500 years ago. We analysed and compared the mitogenomic diversity among Sacred Ibis mummies to that found in modern Sacred Ibis populations from throughout Africa. The ancient birds show a high level of genetic variation comparable to that identified in modern African populations, contrary to the suggestion in ancient hieroglyphics (or ancient writings) of centralized industrial scale farming of sacrificial birds. This suggests a sustained short-term taming of the wild migratory Sacred Ibis for the ritual yearly demand.},

  abstract  = {Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) are gaining considerable interest as a geolocation tool and are now widely applied in archaeology, ecology, and forensic research. However, their application for provenance requires the development of baseline models predicting surficial 87Sr/86Sr variations (“isoscapes”). A variety of empirically-based and process-based models have been proposed to build terrestrial 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes but, in their current forms, those models are not mature enough to be integrated with continuous-probability surface models used in geographic assignment. In this study, we aim to overcome those limitations and to predict 87Sr/86Sr variations across Western Europe by combining process-based models and a series of remote-sensing geospatial products into a regression framework. We find that random forest regression significantly outperforms other commonly used regression and interpolation methods, and efficiently predicts the multi-scale patterning of 87Sr/86Sr variations by accounting for geological, geomorphological and atmospheric controls. Random forest regression also provides an easily interpretable and flexible framework to integrate different types of environmental auxiliary variables required to model the multi-scale patterning of 87Sr/86Sr variability. The method is transferable to different scales and resolutions and can be applied to the large collection of geospatial data available at local and global levels. The isoscape generated in this study provides the most accurate 87Sr/86Sr predictions in bioavailable strontium for Western Europe (R2 = 0.58 and RMSE = 0.0023) to date, as well as a conservative estimate of spatial uncertainty by applying quantile regression forest. We anticipate that the method presented in this study combined with the growing numbers of bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data and satellite geospatial products will extend the applicability of the 87Sr/86Sr geo-profiling tool in provenance applications.},

The isotopic abundance of Sr 87 , expressed as the Sr 87 /Sr 86 ratio, for twelve basalts, dolerites, gabbros, and peridotites is 0.7058±0.0010. On the other hand, the average initial Sr 87 /Sr 86 ratio for one granite from the Eastern Redhills Complex and for three granites from the Western Redhills Complex is 0.7124±0.0015. The three principal members of the marscoite suite of the Western Redhills Centre, namely, ferrodiorite, porphyritic felsite, and marscoite, also have significantly higher initial Sr 87 /Sr 86 ratios than the basaltic rocks. It is concluded that the rocks with high initial ratios were derived from a source with significantly higher Rb/Sr ratio than that of the basaltic rocks. The hypothesis which is most in accord with the isotopic evidence is that the granitic rocks and the marscoite suite were produced by partial melting of ancient Lewisian rocks, which form the underlying basement at no great depth in this area. Rb—Sr (and K-Ar) age determinations were carried out on some representative rocks from the Eastern and Western Redhills Centres. It was not possible to establish a significant age difference between any of the rock units from either Centres. The mean age is 54±3 m.y. and suggests that intrusion of the granitic rocks of Skye occurred during a relatively short period of time within the Lower or Middle Eocene peroid.}},
