  abstract = {The use of bioavailable strontium in different environments to provenance biological materials has become increasingly common since its first applications in ecology and archaeology almost four decades ago. Provenancing biological materials using strontium isotope ratios requires a map of bioavailable strontium, commonly known as an isoscape, to compare results with. Both producing the isoscape and using it to interpret results present methodological challenges that researchers must carefully consider. A review of current research indicates that, while many archives can be analyzed to produce isoscapes, modern plant materials usually provide the best approximation of bioavailable strontium and can be used alone or combined with other archives if applying machine learning. Domain mapping currently produces the most accurate, most interpretable isoscapes for most research questions; however, machine learning approaches promise to provide more accurate and geographically wide-ranging isoscapes over time. Using strontium isotope analysis for provenancing is most successful when combined with other isotopes and/or trace elements as part of a likelihood approach. Strontium isoscapes that are both appropriate and sufficiently high resolution to answer specific research questions do not exist for most parts of the world. Researchers intending to incorporate strontium analysis into their research designs should expect to conduct primary sampling and analysis to create appropriate isoscapes or refine existing ones, which should themselves not be uncritically utilized. When sampling, it is essential to collect appropriate metadata; these metadata and the results of the analyses should be archived in one of several online databases to maximize their usefulness. With increasing amounts of primary data and the likely increased availability of machine learning approaches to mapping, strontium analysis will continue to improve as a method of provenancing.}

  abstract = {{Isotope analysis has become an increasingly valuable tool in forensic anthropology casework over the past decade. Modern-day isotopic investigations on human remains have integrated the use of multi-isotope profiles (e.g. C, N, O, H, S, Sr, and Pb) as well as isotopic landscapes (“isoscapes”) from multiple body tissues (e.g. teeth, bone, hair, and nails) to predict possible region-of-origin of unidentified human remains. Together, data from various isotope analyses provide additional lines of evidence for human identification, including a decedent’s possible region-of-birth, long-term adult residence, recent travel history, and dietary choices. Here, we present the basic principles of isotope analysis and provide a brief overview of instrumentation, analytical standards, sample selection, and sample quality measures. Finally, we present case studies that reflect the diverse applications of isotope analysis to the medicolegal system before describing some future research directions. As shown herein, isotope analysis is a flexible and powerful geolocation tool that can provide new investigative leads for unidentified human remains cases.}},

  abstract = {Two men walking across a bridge along highway I-75 found a young woman's body floating in the water below. This 1971 case has since become known as the “Little Miss Panasofkee” case. It is still an open homicide, for which neither the victim nor the perpetrator have been identified. Throughout the United States, thousands of similar cases remain open. The medicolegal communities work on these cases, as the years pass, applying new scientific methods and following new leads as they can be developed. As the years pass, the priorities of the investigations often shift. In any homicide investigation the goal is to solve the murder and bring the perpetrator to justice. While this is still true for long-term open or cold cases, the needs of families to know the truth, find and bury remains, and find closure outside of criminal trials become increasingly important. In the case study presented here, we reanalyzed the biological profile of the decedent, created a new facial approximation and imaging for visualization of personal evidence, and analyzed samples of hair, bone, and enamel for Sr, Pb, C, N, and O isotopes to decipher a geographical place of origin for the decedent. Hair data show a shift from lighter to heavier C isotopic values indicating a diet change from more grain-based (hair tip) to more corn-based (hair root) diet. Oxygen isotopes in teeth show relatively heavy isotopic values suggesting southern geographical origin near a major water basin. Lead isotopic data for teeth and bone samples show relatively low-radiogenic values suggesting that the victim was born and raised in Europe. There is shift to low 87Sr/86Sr from first to third molar and bone indicating possible migration and dietary change. Taken together, the radiogenic and stable isotope data indicate that the decedent was foreign born. The shift in the hair C isotopes suggests that the victim arrived in Florida/United States between 2 and 12 months before she was murdered. The Pb isotope data suggest European origin. Considering all of the chemical data, including Pb concentrations and Pb, Sr, O, and C isotope analyses on teeth, rib, and hair samples, we can suggest that the victim was most likely a foreigner from southeastern Europe, possibly Greece. The methods used here and the impact of these methods for developing new leads for investigators decades later are discussed and provide new avenues of investigation for other unsolved cases.},

  abstract      = {Strontium isotopic analysis of sequentially formed tissues, such as tooth enamel, is commonly used to study provenance and mobility of humans and animals. However, the potential of 87Sr/86Sr in tooth enamel to track high-frequency movements has not yet been established, in part due to the lack of data on modern animals of known movement and predictive model of isotope variation across the landscape. To tackle this issue, we measured the 87Sr/86Sr in plant samples taken from a 2000 km2 area in the Altai Mountains (Mongolia), and the 87Sr/86Sr in tooth enamel of domestic caprines whose mobility was monitored using GPS tracking. We show that high-resolution, sequential profiles of strontium isotope composition of tooth enamel reliably reflect the high-frequency mobility of domestic livestock and that short-term residency of about 45 days can be resolved. This offers new perspectives in various disciplines, including forensics, ecology, palaeoanthropology, and bioarchaeology.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Strontium (Sr) isotope analysis can provide detailed biogeographical and ecological information about modern and ancient organisms. Because Sr isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) in biologically relevant materials such as water, soil, vegetation, and animal tissues predominantly reflect local geology, they can be used to distinguish geologically distinct regions as well as identify highly mobile individuals or populations. While the application of Sr isotope analysis to biological research has been steadily increasing, high analytical costs have prohibited more widespread use. Additionally, accessibility of this geochemical tool has been hampered due to limited understanding of (i) the degree to which biologically relevant materials differ in their spatial averaging of 87Sr/86Sr ratios, and (ii) how these differences may be affected by lithologic complexity. A recently developed continental-scale model that accounts for variability in bedrock weathering rates and predicts Sr isotope ratios of surface water could help resolve these questions. In addition, if this ‘local water’ model can accurately predict 87Sr/86Sr ratios for other biologically relevant materials, there would be reduced need for researchers to assess regional Sr isotope patterns empirically. Here, we compile 87Sr/86Sr data for surface water, soil, vegetation, and mammalian and fish skeletal tissues from the literature and compare the accuracy with which the local water model predicts Sr isotope data among these five materials across the contiguous USA. We find that measured Sr isotope ratios for all five materials are generally close to those predicted by the local water model, although not with uniform accuracy. Mammal skeletal tissues are most accurately predicted, particularly in regions with low variability in 87Sr/86Sr predicted by the local water model. Increasing regional geologic heterogeneity increases both the offset and variance between modelled and empirical Sr isotope ratios, but its effects are broadly similar across materials. The local water model thus provides a readily available source of background data for predicting 87Sr/86Sr for biologically relevant materials in places where empirical data are lacking. The availability of increasingly high-quality modelled Sr data will dramatically expand the accessibility of this geochemical tool to ecological applications.},

  abstract = {Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) are a popular tool in provenance applications in archeology, forensics, paleoecology, and environmental sciences. Using bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr in provenance studies requires comparing the 87Sr/86Sr of a sample of interest to that of 87Sr/86Sr baselines. Historically, these baselines required building empirical datasets from plants or local animals to characterize the 87Sr/86Sr available to local ecosystems (bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr). However, researchers are increasingly relying on modeled bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr maps (called isoscapes). We review the advantages and limitations of existing approaches to mapping bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr for provenance studies and propose a globally applicable, scalable, and editable framework for creating bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes. This framework relies on: 1) Compiling global bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data; 2) Mapping 87Sr/86Sr variability in rocks; 3) Leveraging global environmental covariates; and 4) Applying a random forest regression method that integrates these data to predict bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr. When the random-forest model is applied at the global scale it performs well (explaining 60% of the variance of the global bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr dataset), and accounts for geological, geomorphological and atmospheric controls. In data-rich regions (e.g., Europe), the global bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr isoscape can be successfully extrapolated to broad regions without bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data. However, we also show that this extrapolation may not be valid in exceptionally geologically complex and data-poor regions (e.g., Madagascar). We suggest research directions to improve the accuracy of global bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes, which include: 1) Increasing the collection of bioavailable datasets in data-poor regions; 2) Harmonizing data management practices and metadata collection for bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data; and 3) Relying on advances in remote sensing and geological mapping techniques to improve geological covariates. While significant potential to refine 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes remains, the data products provided in this review form a basis for using 87Sr/86Sr data in large-scale provenance studies, opening new research avenues in a range of fields.}

However, traditional interpolation algorithms and classification approaches used to generate Sr isoscapes are often limited in predicting multiscale 87Sr/86Sr patterning. Here we investigate the suitability of plant samples and soil leachates from the IRHUM database (www.irhumdatabase.com) to create a bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr map using a novel geostatistical framework. First, we generated an 87Sr/86Sr map by classifying 87Sr/86Sr values into five geologically-representative isotope groups using cluster analysis. The isotope groups were then used as a covariate in kriging to integrate prior geological knowledge of Sr cycling with the information contained in the bioavailable dataset and enhance 87Sr/86Sr predictions. Our approach couples the strengths of classification and geostatistical methods to generate more accurate 87Sr/86Sr predictions (Root Mean Squared Error = 0.0029) with an estimate of spatial uncertainty based on lithology and sample density. This bioavailable Sr isoscape is applicable for provenance studies in France, and the method is transferable to other areas with high sampling density. While our method is a step forward in generating accurate 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes, the remaining uncertainty also demonstrates that fine-modelling of 87Sr/86Sr variability is challenging and requires more than geological maps for accurately predicting 87Sr/86Sr variations across the landscape. Future efforts should focus on increasing sampling density and developing predictive models to further quantify and predict the processes that lead to 87Sr/86Sr variability.}

  abstract      = {Archaeological glass contains information about the movement of goods and ancient economies, yet our understanding of critical aspects of the ancient glass industry is fragmentary. During Roman times, distinct glass types produced in coastal regions of Egypt and the Levant used evaporitic soda (natron) mixed with Nile-derived sands. In the Levant, furnaces for producing colourless Roman glass by addition of manganese have been uncovered, whereas the source of the desirable antimony-decolourised Roman glass remains an enigma. In the Edict of Diocletian, this colourless glass is listed as ``Alexandrian''referring to Egypt, but its origin has been ambiguous. Previous studies have found overlapping strontium and neodymium isotope ratios for Levantine and Egyptian glass. Here, we confirm these findings and show for the first time, based on glasses from the ancient city of Gerasa, that hafnium (Hf) isotopes are different in Egyptian and Levantine natron glasses, and that Sb Roman glass is Egyptian. Our work illustrates the value of Hf isotopes in provenancing archaeological glass. We attribute the striking difference in Hf isotopes of Egyptian versus Levantine glasses to sorting of zircons in Nile sediments during longshore drift and aeolian transport along the south-eastern Mediterranean coast leaving behind a less juvenile fraction.},
